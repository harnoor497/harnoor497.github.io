<h4> How do you believe in a mystery, in something you don't understand and can't prove? When we're children we're encouraged to believe in some mysterious things that turn out to not necessarily be true at all -- things like the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny or the flag. Naturally, we're disappointed after our illusions have been shattered, but usually we get over it. Some of us, however, become skeptical, even cynical, after that.
    We live in a universe that is infinite in all directions… even if it curves back on itself.</h4>

                You cannot see beyond its horizons.
                <br>            
                You cannot taste all of its fruits—human scales are too small.
                <br>        
                You cannot know even a small fraction of its mysteries—you can, at best, uncover one or two plausible insights as you journey through the void.
                <br>    
                The choice that you should make is not which mysteries to believe in (my dog believes in the mysterious power of ball and stick and tug—belief is an empty bowl), but which “truths” to challenge.
                <br>
                I believe in mystery because every answer to every question starts with at least one assumption, and assumptions are not knowledge.
                <br>
                I don’t believe in fairies, lizard people, a flat earth, angry gods, because the base assumptions informing these beliefs stem from fear of mystery.

                <br>
                A great statement is:
                        <br>
                In the entire universe what is possible to be happen we can't think ,we can't imagine, more than ,meansWhose face did you create in your mind ACCTUALY she has existence in this world any where she could be around in any time but imagination will be happens is truth.!.!.!

                So Why to believe in mysteries? What do you mean? They exist so  I know they are out there. It isn’t a belief that mysteries exist it’s a fact. In fact it’s a mystery to me what you were trying to ask and it seems like maybe it’s a mystery to you how to ask it. Feel me?
